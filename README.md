## 📌 Interview Tips

> These are collected from real coding interview rounds.

1. **Always state the time and space complexity** before coding — interviewers expect it.
2. **Start with a brute-force** approach, then optimize — shows structured thinking.
3. **Use descriptive variable names** — `left/right` over `i/j` for two-pointer problems.
4. **Test with edge cases**: empty input, single element, all duplicates, negative numbers.
5. **Know the Pythonic way**: tuple swap, list comprehension, `dict.get()`, `set` operations.
